An implementations team member needs help figuring out which strings in his text file for import are good or bad.
A good string is one with all of the following properties:
It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou. It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd). It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements. For example:
•	ugknbfddgicrmopn is good because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
•	aaa is good because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
•	jchzalrnumimnmhp is bad because it has no double letter.
•	haegwjzuvuyypxyu is bad because it contains the string xy.
•	dvszwmarrgswjxmb is bad because it contains only one vowel.
How many strings are good?
